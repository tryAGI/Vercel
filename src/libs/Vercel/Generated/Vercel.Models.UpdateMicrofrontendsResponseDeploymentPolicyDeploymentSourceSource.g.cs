    /// Customer-configurable deployment sources. Every deploy classifies to exactly one. JSON schema in `packages/deployment-policy/schemas/body.ts` enumerates exactly these values. - `'git'` — git provider webhook. - `'cli'` — Vercel CLI (legacy classic-token CLI and SIWV CLI both). - `'rest-api'` — direct user/team-token REST upload. Does NOT cover deploy hooks, Marketplace integrations, or first-party app tokens. - `'deploy-hook'` — project deploy-hook URL. The URL is the credential. - `'integration'` — third-party Marketplace actor: Marketplace integration token, user-delegated OAuth from a Marketplace app, or an unrecognized third-party Vercel App. First-party Vercel Apps are never `'integration'`. First-party Vercel apps (v0, Toolbar, etc.) classify as `'first-party'` — see `ClassifiedSource` in `./checks`. They're not in this union because they aren't customer-configurable; they bypass `checkDeploymentSources` entirely.
